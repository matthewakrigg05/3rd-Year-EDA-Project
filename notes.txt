Notes file for keeping track of the resources I use when programming this project
and some of the more generic methodology details that I am likely going to have to write
about when it comes to writing up this project in 3rd year.

Rough Methodology:
- Collect data from reddit discussing trump and his antics
- Find common topics by analysing titles and common words in the texts using frequency matching and named entities
- main is going to act as a console application to allow me to choose whether i need to analyse or collect more data
