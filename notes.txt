Notes file for keeping track of the resources I use when programming this project
and some of the more generic methodology details that I am likely going to have to write
about when it comes to writing up this project in 3rd year.

Rough Methodology:
- Collect loads of articles from various sources across US, UK and AUS+NZ
- Find common topics by analysing headlines (maybe full texts) using frequency matching and named entities
