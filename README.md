Project designed to put my data analysis and web scraping skills to the test
the aim of this being to analyse tweets from the US presidential election
from last year. Seeing what sentiments are attached to the likes of Trump,
 Biden, Harris and the election itself. The choice of topic is due to the 
 likely large volume of data and the fact that it was relatively recent.
